    "Second, many algorithms use multiple threads for training and inference. Since training takes place on the spark driver node, it is okay if model training with multiple threads. For inference the model *should not* use multiple threads as it will cause significant over subscription of the processor and lead to extremely slow model inference times (including during active learning). Fortunately, sklearn provides an easy way to disable threading \n",
